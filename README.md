# GitHub Action: Telegram Event Notifier

This GitHub Action sends GitHub events as messages to a Telegram chat or channel or group or a specific topic in a group or thread.

## Usage

To use this GitHub Action, you need to have a Telegram bot token and a chat ID.

1. Create a new Telegram bot by talking to the [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram and follow the instructions to obtain the bot token.

2. Find out the chat ID where you want to receive the event messages. You can use the [getUpdates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates) API method or search for the bot username in the Telegram app to get the chat ID.

3. In your GitHub repository, create a new workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/telegram-event-notifier.yml`) and define the following:

```yaml
